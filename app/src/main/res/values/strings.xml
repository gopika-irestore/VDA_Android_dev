<p><b>5. Privacy Policy.</b> Your privacy matters to us so please do take the time to get to know our practices &ndash; and if you have any questions contact us. </p>

<p><b>Information we collect:</b> We collect information to provide damage reports to utility customers &ndash; reports of wires or poles down, for example, to speed diagnosis and repair of utility damage associated with power outages.<br />
<b>Information you give us.</b> For example, iRestore requires users to sign up and create an account. When you do, we&rsquo;ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or organization to store with your account. <br />
<b>Information we get from your use of our services.</b> We <b>collect information</b> about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you report a downed wire using the iRestore app, visit a website that shows damage reports, or <b>view and interact with iRestore content.</b> This information includes: <br />
<b>Device information</b> <br />
We collect device&not;-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Business Radar may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your iRestore Account. <br />
<b>Log information</b><br />
</p><p>When you use our services or view content provided by Business Radar, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes: <br />
details of how you used our service, such as your app usage log information, your phone number, time and date of reports, number of reports, SMS routing information and Internet protocol address.<br />
Also device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.<br />
cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your iRestore Account. <br />
<b>Location information</b> <br />
When you use iRestore, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Business Radar with information on nearby devices, Wi&not;Fi access points and cell towers. <br />
<b>Unique application numbers</b> <br />
Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Business Radar when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. <br />
<b>Local storage</b> <br />
We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. <br />
Cookies and similar technologies <br />
We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit iRestore, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. <br />
<b>How we use information we collect</b> <br />
We use the information we collect from all of our services to enable our utility customers and iRestore users to create and share location-tagged images and videos of utility asset damage. We use the information to provide, maintain, protect and improve iRestore products, to develop new ones, and to protect Business Radar and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content &ndash; like giving you more relevant search results. <br />
We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. <br />
Business Radar processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. <br />

<b>With your consent</b> <br />
</p><p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals when you submit a damage report in iRestore. Your use and submission of a report in iRestore grants Business Radar opt&not;in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. This is important for security purposes and to validate the information flowing into iRestore.<br />
<b>For damage response</b> <br />
We provide personal information to our utility customers, municipalities or other trusted businesses or persons to alert them of damage so that they may respond appropriately. <br />
<b>For legal reasons</b> <br />
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Business Radar if we have a good&not; faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: <br />
meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.<br />
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.<br />
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<br />
protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Business Radar, our users or the public as required or permitted by law. <br />
<b>We may share aggregated</b>, non&not;personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners &ndash; like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly <b>to show trends</b> about the general use of our services. <br />
If Business Radar is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal <br />
information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. <br />
<b>Information security</b> <br />
We work hard to protect iRestore users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular, we encrypt many of our services using SSL.</p>

<p><b>Changes</b> <br />
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). </p>
